# CPAT-examples

A total of 88 samples were analyzed in this study, a subset of the 137 samples from the CDC Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program (GeT-RM) PGx study.

The test germline VCF files after tailoring based on the loci covered by CPAT are saved in the `vcf` directory, and the corresponding CPAT reports are saved in the `report` directory. In addition, the CPAT runs require information on the population to which each sample belongs, so an additional `metadata` is provided.

The raw VCF files were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project, that were re-sequenced and analyzed by the New York Genome Center at 30x coverage (Byrska-Bishop et al., 2021) and are available at http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20190425_NYGC_GATK/raw_calls_updated/.
